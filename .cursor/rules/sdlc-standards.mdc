- Follow Research, Plan, and Implement lifecycle.
- Document research in docs/research/research-[description]-[yyyy-MM-dd]-[sequence].md.
- Document action plans in docs/plans/plan-[description]-[yyyy-MM-dd]-[sequence].md.
- Document requirements and specifications in docs/specs/spec-[description]-[yyyy-MM-dd]-[sequence].md.
- Document issues/bugs in docs/issues/issue-[description]-[yyyy-MM-dd]-[sequence].md.
- Document apis in docs/apis/api-[description]-[yyyy-MM-dd]-[sequence].md.
- Document notes in docs/notes/note-[description]-[yyyy-MM-dd]-[sequence].md.
- Document configuration in docs/configuration/configuration-[description]-[yyyy-MM-dd]-[sequence].md.
- Research shall include exploration of existing solutions, libraries, and tools.
- Plans shall detail requirements, acceptance criteria, testing strategy (e.g. TDD and BDD), and a step-by-step implementation guide.
- Each action plan shall be sub-divided into stages (e.g. Stage-1, Stage-2), while stages are subdivided into tasks (e.g. Task-[Stage].1, Task-[Stage].2).
- Implementation lifecycle shall always: code failing tests, then implement code, then run tests, then iteratively refactor and run tests until all tests pass.
- Every feature must start as a standalone library before integration:
  - Develop features as independent, reusable library components first
  - Only integrate into larger applications after proving standalone functionality
- Software tools, primary libraries, data tools, and development tools must expose their functionality through a CLI. Other software functionality may omit a CLI if appropriate.
- If in doubt, prompt user for clarification and mark as [NEEDS CLARIFICATION].
- Always ask for user confirmation before making significant changes.
- Always ask for user confirmation before deleting files or data.
- Always ask for user confirmation before overwriting existing files.
- Use git for version control with feature branches and pull requests.
- Write clear, concise commit messages in the imperative mood (e.g., "Add feature", "Fix bug").
