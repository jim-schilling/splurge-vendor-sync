- Add comments before complex logic blocks to explain the "why" and "what".
- Use inline comments sparingly, only for complex or non-obvious code sections.
- Remove outdated comments during refactoring instead of accumulating them.
- Use Google-style docstrings for all public functions, classes, and modules in Python:
  ```python
  def process_data(input_file: str) -> dict:
      """Process input file and return structured data.

      Args:
          input_file: Path to the input file to process

      Returns:
          Dictionary containing processed data

      Raises:
          FileNotFoundError: If input file doesn't exist
      """
  ```
